# Marxists.org

*I am not affiliated with marxists.org at this time.*

The following is a reimaged front-end for marxists.org.

Marxists.org is scraped using the [marxists-parser](https://github.com/MarxistsDev/marxists-parser), this is an other repo.

The ui is currently not that good, but I hope others more experience with tailwind, htmx, and templ (templating for go).

Please feel free to share your ideas in the `Discussions` Tab.
